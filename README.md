# Functional Programming in Scala
Coursera Scala Specialization "Program on a Higher Level" 2016 August session. https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala

> This Specialization provides a hands-on introduction to functional programming using the widespread programming language, Scala. It begins from the basic building blocks of the functional paradigm, first showing how to use these blocks to solve small problems, before building up to combining these concepts to architect larger functional programs. You'll see how the functional paradigm facilitates parallel and distributed programming, and through a series of hands on examples and programming assignments, you'll learn how to analyze data sets small to large; from parallel programming on multicore architectures, to distributed programming on a cluster using Apache Spark. A final capstone project will allow you to apply the skills you learned by building a large data-intensive application using real-world data.

## Functional Programming Principles in Scala
Learning Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to:

 - understand the principles of functional programming,
 - write purely functional programs, using recursion,
   pattern matching, and higher-order functions,
 - combine functional programming with objects and classes,
 - design immutable data structures,
 - reason about properties of functions,
 - understand generic types for functional programs

## Functional Program Design in Scala
Learning Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to:

 - recognize and apply design principles of functional programs,
 - design functional libraries and their APIs,
 - competently combine functions and state in one program,
 - understand reasoning techniques for programs that combine 
   functions and state,
 - write simple functional reactive applications.

## Parallel programming
Learning Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to:

- reason about task and data parallel programs,
- express common algorithms in a functional style and solve them in parallel,
- competently microbenchmark parallel code,
- write programs that effectively use parallel collections to achieve performance

## Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark
Learning Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to:

- read data from persistent storage and load it into Apache Spark,
- manipulate data with Spark and Scala,
- express algorithms for data analysis in a functional style, 
- recognize how to avoid shuffles and recomputation in Spark
